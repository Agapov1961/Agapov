				<p class="section-description">DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR EQUIPMENT IMPORT AND OPERATION IN THE EAEU COUNTRIES: RUSSIA, BELARUS, KAZAKHSTAN, ARMENIA AND KYRGYZSTAN</p>		
<p class="section-description">
<p>
<b>General</b><br>
There are a number of documents which could be required for the importation and operation of industrial equipment in the EAEU countries, depending on their nature and application:
<br><br>
1. At the stage of Customs clearance
<ul>
<li>CU TR / Certificate / Declaration of Conformity / Letter of Exemption</li>
<li>Fire Safety Certificate (for fire detecting and firefighting equipment, fire dampers etc.)</li>
<li>Certificate of State Registration (for very specific goods, i.e. certain chemicals)</li></ul>

2. At the stage of Commissioning and Operation
<ul>
<li>CU TR/ Certificate(s) / Declaration(s) of Conformity;</li>
<li>Fire Safety certificate(s);</li>
<li>Metrology (Pattern Approval) Certificate(s);</li>
<li>Technical Passport(s).</li>
<li>Strength Calculations;</li>
<li>Safety Justification (SJ);</li>
<li>IOM Manual (in local language).</li>


</ul>

The above-mentioned list varies depending on the type of equipment and scope of supply.<br>
At inquiry stage, RUS Inspection will review the relevant technical documentation and will confirm the applicable documents for specific packages and goods.


<p>
<b>Customs Union (CU) and Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) Technical Regulations / 
Declaration of Conformity</b><br>

The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), formerly Customs Union (CU), is an economic and customs union of states that came into force on January 2015, undersigned by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. 
<br><br>
 “Custom Union Technical Regulations” (CU TR) were chosen as the format for the unified requirements of the customs union. More than 20 CU/EAEU TRs are currently in force. The CU/EAEU TRs related to industrial equipment are:
<li>	Safety of Machinery and Equipment (CU TR 010/2011)</li>
<li>	Safety of Low Voltage Equipment (CU TR 004/2011)</li>
<li>	Electro-magnetic compatibility of technical devices (CU TR 020/2011)</li>
<li>	Safety of Lifts (CU TR 011/2011)</li>
<li>	Safety of Gas-fueled equipment (CU TR 016/2011)</li>
<li>	Safety of equipment operated in explosive atmospheres (CU TR 012/2011)</li>
<li>	Safety of pressurized equipment (CU TR 032/2013)</li>
<li>	Restriction of hazardous substances in electrical/ electronical equipment (EAEU TR 037/2016) – mandatory from March 2020</li>
<li>	Requirements for Fire Safety and Extinguishing Equipment (EAEU TR 043/2017) – in force from January 2020</li>


Compliance of equipment to the above CU/EAEU TR’s, as applicable, has to be confirmed by a “Certificate of Conformity – CoC” or “Declaration of Conformity – DoC”, instead of the former GOST R, GOST K. CoC / DoC are now the documents required to import the CU equipment falling under CU/EAEU TR. <br>
 
There are two types of CU TR certificate / declaration:

<ul>
<li>	"Batch" or “one-off”, which is valid for a defined batch of goods supplied under a specific contract.</li>
<li>	"Type" or “serial production” certificate / declaration with validity from 1 to 5 years.</li>
</ul>

Changes compared with previous certification procedures: 
<ul>
<li>	The new CU TR can only be applied for and obtained by a local legal entity duly representing foreign manufacturer. Such an entity could be Manufacturer’s local office/representative or a local company acting for Manufacturer, or, in case of contract-limited scope of delivery, local Buyer/Importer of the equipment. </li>
<li>	Copies of registration documents of the local company (INN, OGRN) are needed in all cases, and relevant representation agreement with the Manufacturer is required for Third Party Representative and Manufacturer’s local office options. Such an agreement must be in Russian and must assume all legal responsibilities for the supplied products’ compliance to the CU TR requirements.</li>
<li>	The purpose of this regulation is to simplify claiming procedures for low quality non-reliable equipment. </li>
<li>	Obviously, the local company will require documentation to make sure the equipment is properly designed and built and will charge for the service and risks taken.  RUS Inspection recommends, wherever possible, companies should use their foreign trading partner/representative office, which could be in any of the three countries.</li>
<li>	Most equipment falls under DoC, which has a simpler procedure and can be used for shipment and commissioning of the equipment. RUS Inspection will advise whether actual equipment falls under DoC requirement.</li>
<li>	Most of the required documents are standard design and manufacturing documents, except one document entitled “Justification of Safety”, a document done to GOST 33855-2016. Justification of safety is a document containing risk assessment (typically to ISO 12100-1; 12100-2; EN 1050) and information from design and operating documentation about minimum required safety measures to be followed during all stages of equipment life.</li>

</ul>
RUS Inspection can assist with the issue of CU TR Certificate or Declaration of Conformity as required by the Client.


	
<p>
<b>Letter of Exemption</b><br>
Sometimes there could be different interpretations whether goods belong to a code requiring certification / declaration or not. If it is believed that no certification is needed, a Letter of Exemption (LoE) could be issued. 
RUS Inspection can assist in obtaining of Letter of Exemption in all the cases where such a letter may be helpful in clearing Customs, although it is not strictly necessary
</p>			

<p>
<b>Certificate of State Registration (Hygienic)</b><br>

Since 1 July 2010 hygienic certificates are no longer issued. Previously issued hygienic certificates used to be valid until 1 January 2012. For many types of goods for which hygienic certificates were required before 1 July 2010, no documents are required now. There is so-called State Registration which is required for a short list of the goods, namely:
<ol>
<li>Mineral water, tonic drinks, alcohol beverages including wines and  beers.</li>
<li>Special food products, including food for pregnant women, special dietary food etc.</li>
<li>Food products on basis of GMO.</li>
<li>Food additives and the like.</li>
<li>Cosmetic goods.</li>
<li>Disinfectants and disinfectant materials.</li>
<li>Household chemical goods</li>
<li>Potentially hazardous chemical and biological materials</li>
<li>Potable water treatment equipment</li>
<li>Personal hygiene items</li>
<li>Goods to be in a contact with foodstuff (except for tableware and technological equipment).</li>
</ol>
The procedure to obtain State Registration is complicated, expensive and time-consuming. 
RUS Inspection can assist in obtaining the Certificate of State Registration for your goods.
	
<p>
<b>Fire Safety Certificate </b><br>


A Fire Safety Certificate is a document issued by the Fire Safety Certification Body accredited by Ministry of Emergency and states that the equipment is in line with Russian Fire Technical Regulation. It is being replaced by DoC/CoC EAEU 043/2017 starting from 1st January 2020, existing Fire safety certificates will remain valid to 1st January 2021.:
<br><br>

<b>Permit for operation (RTN for Russia, GGTN K for Kazakhstan, GPN for Belarus)</b><br><br>
<b>Russia. </b><br>
Rostechnadzor do not issue RTN Permits any more since January 2014. CU TR/EAEU  Certificates or Declarations should be obtained instead of RTN Permits. 
<br><br>
<b>Kazakhstan. </b><br>
No changes to the former GGTN K (now CIDS) permit for operation - it remains applicable to equipment destined for hazardous industrial sites. However CU TR certificates/ Declarations are also required.  
<br><br>
<b>Belarus. </b><br>
GPN Permit is not issued any more for equipment which is under CU TR certificate /declaration. As most industrial equipment, for which GPN Permit used to be required previously, is now under CU TR 010 and/or CU TR 032 certificate /declaration, in practice GPN Permit is not required for the import and operation of industrial equipment to Belarus. However, a GPN Permit is still applicable to the design of hazardous processes (typically for chemical and petrochemical industry), e.g. required for a company designing a process plant. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Metrology (Pattern Approval) Certificate</b><br>

This certificate is required for all measuring instruments exhibiting certain measuring range and accuracy. This certificate is issued by national Metrology Authority: Rosstandart in Russia, Committee of Technical Regulation and Metrology in Kazakhstan, State Committee  of Standartization of Rep. of Belarus, on the basis of documents prepared by an accredited Metrology Institute. It declares that the certified instrument 
<ul>
<li>is approved for operation as an official measuring device with the range and accuracy as stated in the Appendix to the certificate</li>
<li>there is an approved calibration procedure to be followed during periodic calibration tests</li>
</ul>
There are two types of Metrology certificate:
<ul>
<li>"Batch" Metrology certificate which is valid for a certain batch of instruments with serial numbers listed in the Certificate, which could be issued on basis of documents</li>
<li>"Type" 5-year Metrology certificate which could be issued on the basis of samples testing and documents. </li>
</ul>
In most cases, a factory visit is not required for Metrology certification, unless the scope of certification is newly developed measuring instruments, having no analogues in this country. Test samples are required for certification tests in all the cases.
<br><br>
RUS Inspection can assist in obtaining both types of Metrology Certification, and can also advise if the instrument in question is already certified or not.

<p>
<b>Technical Passport </b><br>
A Technical Passport is a document to be prepared and signed by the equipment manufacturer / supplier. It contains the technical specification, operating and maintenance instructions, manufacturer's declaration of conformity, as well as maintenance and repairs logbook.
<br><br>
In general, a Technical Passport should be prepared according to GOST 2.601-2013. In addition, there are special formats of Technical Passport for certain types of equipment,  such as vessels, boilers, exhaust stacks, rupture discs, lifting equipment etc. 
RUS Inspection can help with Technical Passport preparation in one of two ways. 
<br><br>
<u>Standard assistance:</u> - RUS Inspection provides a Technical Passport (TP) "template" in English or English/Russian for Client to complete. This will be reviewed by RUS Inspection, translated into Russian and returned to the Client by e-mail for further hard-copy issue and verification. 
<br><br>
<u>Full assistance:</u> – This option assumes completion of TP by RUS Inspection based on Client’s design and manufacturing documentation. Translation of attachment to TP’s, such as drawings / datasheets / manuals etc. can also be done by RUS Inspection for an additional cost.
